To the editor:

Authors who have their work accepted to Nature can now pay 9500 Euros
to make their work open access [1].  Whilst this may (or may not)
reflect the underlying costs to the publisher, when most budgets are
squeezed this is an extremely large amount of money for authors to
pay.  Luckily, authors who are either mandated by their funders or who
support open access have another route available to them.

cOAlition S have developed a rights retention strategy [2] that allows
authors to share their author accepted manuscript (AAM) without
embargo.  It is simple and elegant -- authors need only: (1) Add the
following text, e.g. to the cover page or acknowledgements, to their
manuscript before submission to a journal: "A CC BY or equivalent
licence is applied to the AAM arising from this submission." (2) If
the article is accepted for publication, they can deposit their AAM in
a public repository.

The main concern from an author's perspective is whether a journal
would desk-reject any article using the Rights Retention Strategy.  I
hope that Nature will embrace, rather than oppose, this way of
allowing authors to retain rights over their own work and support
the open access movement.

Here's the letter I wrote to the editor of Nature asking if they will embrace the Rights Retention Strategy.   Guess what, no response.
